			<span>We, the human race I mean, are visual creatures. Seeing is believing and all that. This is why so much of web design is focused on graphic design. Keep that in mind always. We are web developers. That means we have to have an understanding of how to manipulate the visuals in the digital environment.

				When working with images, it's best to stick with one of two types. Jpegs (.jpg) are small files that load easily into your page. The drawbacks to jpegs is that they don't support transparency. Portable Network Graphics images (.PNG) are a little bigger, but they do support transparency.
				
				Before you dive into this construction, download the Working With Images Construction Files and unzip it somewhere on your drive.
				
				This file contains all of the images you'll need for this construction as well as an empty HTML template.</span>
